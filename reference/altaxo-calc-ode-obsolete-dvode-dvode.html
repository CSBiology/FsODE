             F must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling program.

             externally to DVODE, an extra call to F should be made
             for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
             If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DVINDY instead.

             When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
             to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
             For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
             in order to determine the direction of the integration
             (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
             scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
             (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
            
             If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
             the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
             Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
            
             If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
             monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited

             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
             the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
             control the vector e = (e(i)) of estimated local errors
             in Y, according to an inequality of the form
             rms-norm of ( e(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
             where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*abs(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
             and the rms-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
             rms-norm(v) = sqrt(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
             is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
             the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
             The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
             RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).

             4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
            
             When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
             be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
            
             If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
             fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
             error controls can be obtained by substituting
             user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
             the norm calculation.  See Part iv below.
            
             If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
             run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
             components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
             down uniformly.

             Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
             1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
             2  means take one step only and return.
             3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
             beyond t = TOUT and return.
             4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
             5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
            
             Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
             (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
             indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,

             = an index used for input and output to specify the
             the state of the calculation.
            
             In the input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
             1  means this is the first call for the problem
             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
             2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
             tested for legality.)
             3  means this is not the first call, and the
             calculation is to continue normally, but with
             a change in input parameters other than
             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF, ML, MU,
             and any of the optional input except H0.
             (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)
             Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
             as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
             input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful to include
             the initial conditions in the output.)
             Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
             ISTATE = 1 in the input.
            
             In the output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
             1  means nothing was done, as TOUT was equal to T with
             ISTATE = 1 in the input.
             2  means the integration was performed successfully.
             -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
             steps) was done on this call, before completing the
             requested task, but the integration was otherwise
             successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
             and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
             simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again.
             (The excess work step counter will be reset to 0.)
             In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
             this error return.  (See optional input below.)
             -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
             of the machine being used.  This was detected before
             completing the requested task, but the integration
             was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
             parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
             to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
             purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
             taking any steps, then an illegal input return
             (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
             -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
             integration steps.  See written message for details.
             Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
             to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
             the run to stop.
             -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
             one attempted step, before completing the requested
             task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
             The problem may have a singularity, or the input
             may be inappropriate.
             -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
             one attempted step, before completing the requested
             task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
             This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix,
             if one is being used.
             -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
             integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
             was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
             The integration was successful as far as T.
            
             Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
             it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
             Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
             regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
             user to change it, and possibly other input, before
             calling the solver again.

             SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD,

             dimension of NROWPD.  T and Y have the same meaning as in
             Subroutine F.
             In the full matrix case (MITER = 1), ML and MU are
             ignored, and the Jacobian is to be loaded into PD in
             columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into PD(i,j).
             In the band matrix case (MITER = 4), the elements

             manner, with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows
             of PD. Thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into PD(i-j+MU+1,j).
             ML and MU are the half-bandwidth parameters. (See IWORK).
             The locations in PD in the two triangular areas which
             correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored
             or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by DVODE.
             JAC need not provide df/dy exactly.  A crude
             approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
             In either case, PD is preset to zero by the solver,
             so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
             Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to F with the same
             arguments NEQ, T, and Y.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
             intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
             saved in a user COMMON block by F and not recomputed by JAC,
             if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if desired.
             JAC must be declared external in the calling program.
             Subroutine JAC may access user-defined real and integer
             work arrays, RPAR and IPAR, whose dimensions are set by the
             user in the main program.

             MF are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
             -11, -12, -14, -15, -21, -22, -24, -25.
             MF is a signed two-digit integer, MF = JSV*(10*METH + MITER).
             JSV = SIGN(MF) indicates the Jacobian-saving strategy:
             JSV =  1 means a copy of the Jacobian is saved for reuse
             in the corrector iteration algorithm.
             JSV = -1 means a copy of the Jacobian is not saved
             (valid only for MITER = 1, 2, 4, or 5).
             METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
             METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
             METH = 2 means the method based on backward
             differentiation formulas (BDF-s).
             MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
             MITER = 0 means functional iteration (no Jacobian matrix
             is involved).
             MITER = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
             full (NEQ by NEQ) Jacobian.
             MITER = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
             generated (difference quotient) full Jacobian
             (using NEQ extra calls to F per df/dy value).
             MITER = 3 means chord iteration with an internally
             generated diagonal Jacobian approximation
             (using 1 extra call to F per df/dy evaluation).
             MITER = 4 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
             banded Jacobian.
             MITER = 5 means chord iteration with an internally
             generated banded Jacobian (using ML+MU+1 extra
             calls to F per df/dy evaluation).
             If MITER = 1 or 4, the user must supply a subroutine JAC
             (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
             For other values of MITER, a dummy argument can be used.

             DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(NEQ), YDOT(NEQ), RPAR

             is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
             Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).
             F must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling program.

             For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
             in order to determine the direction of the integration
             (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
             scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
             (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
            
             If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
             the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
             Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.

             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
             the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
             control the vector e = (e(i)) of estimated local errors

             rms-norm of ( e(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
             where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*abs(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
             and the rms-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
             rms-norm(v) = sqrt(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
             is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
             the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.

             RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
            
             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
             1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
             2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
             3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
             4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
            
             When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
             be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
            
             If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
             fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
             error controls can be obtained by substituting
             user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
             the norm calculation.  See Part iv below.
            
             If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
             run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
             components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
             down uniformly.

             Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
             1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
             2  means take one step only and return.
             3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or

             4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
             5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
            
             Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
             (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
             indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,

             = an index used for input and output to specify the
             the state of the calculation.
            
             In the input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
             1  means this is the first call for the problem
             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
             2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
             tested for legality.)
             3  means this is not the first call, and the
             calculation is to continue normally, but with
             a change in input parameters other than
             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF, ML, MU,
             and any of the optional input except H0.
             (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)
             Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
             as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
             input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful to include
             the initial conditions in the output.)
             Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
             ISTATE = 1 in the input.
            
             In the output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
             1  means nothing was done, as TOUT was equal to T with
             ISTATE = 1 in the input.
             2  means the integration was performed successfully.
             -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
             steps) was done on this call, before completing the
             requested task, but the integration was otherwise
             successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
             and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
             simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again.
             (The excess work step counter will be reset to 0.)
             In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
             this error return.  (See optional input below.)
             -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
             of the machine being used.  This was detected before
             completing the requested task, but the integration
             was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
             parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
             to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
             purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
             taking any steps, then an illegal input return
             (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
             -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
             integration steps.  See written message for details.
             Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
             to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
             the run to stop.
             -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
             one attempted step, before completing the requested
             task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
             The problem may have a singularity, or the input
             may be inappropriate.
             -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
             one attempted step, before completing the requested
             task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
             This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix,
             if one is being used.
             -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
             integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
             was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
             The integration was successful as far as T.
            
             Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
             it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
             Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
             regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
             user to change it, and possibly other input, before
             calling the solver again.

             (See the MF description for METH and MITER.)
             Thus if MAXORD has its default value and NEQ is constant,

             DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(NEQ), PD(NROWPD,NEQ), RPAR
             where NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, and NROWPD are input and the array
             PD is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements of the
             Jacobian matrix) in the output.  PD must be given a first
             dimension of NROWPD.  T and Y have the same meaning as in
             Subroutine F.
             In the full matrix case (MITER = 1), ML and MU are
             ignored, and the Jacobian is to be loaded into PD in
             columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into PD(i,j).
             In the band matrix case (MITER = 4), the elements
             within the band are to be loaded into PD in columnwise
             manner, with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows
             of PD. Thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into PD(i-j+MU+1,j).
             ML and MU are the half-bandwidth parameters. (See IWORK).
             The locations in PD in the two triangular areas which
             correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored
             or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by DVODE.
             JAC need not provide df/dy exactly.  A crude
             approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
             In either case, PD is preset to zero by the solver,
             so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
             Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to F with the same
             arguments NEQ, T, and Y.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
             intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
             saved in a user COMMON block by F and not recomputed by JAC,
             if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if desired.
             JAC must be declared external in the calling program.
             Subroutine JAC may access user-defined real and integer
             work arrays, RPAR and IPAR, whose dimensions are set by the
             user in the main program.

             = The method flag.  Used only for input.  The legal values of
             MF are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
             -11, -12, -14, -15, -21, -22, -24, -25.
             MF is a signed two-digit integer, MF = JSV*(10*METH + MITER).
             JSV = SIGN(MF) indicates the Jacobian-saving strategy:
             JSV =  1 means a copy of the Jacobian is saved for reuse
             in the corrector iteration algorithm.
             JSV = -1 means a copy of the Jacobian is not saved
             (valid only for MITER = 1, 2, 4, or 5).
             METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
             METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
             METH = 2 means the method based on backward
             differentiation formulas (BDF-s).
             MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
             MITER = 0 means functional iteration (no Jacobian matrix
             is involved).
             MITER = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
             full (NEQ by NEQ) Jacobian.
             MITER = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
             generated (difference quotient) full Jacobian
             (using NEQ extra calls to F per df/dy value).
             MITER = 3 means chord iteration with an internally
             generated diagonal Jacobian approximation
             (using 1 extra call to F per df/dy evaluation).
             MITER = 4 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
             banded Jacobian.
             MITER = 5 means chord iteration with an internally
             generated banded Jacobian (using ML+MU+1 extra
             calls to F per df/dy evaluation).
             If MITER = 1 or 4, the user must supply a subroutine JAC
             (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
             For other values of MITER, a dummy argument can be used.
